<h1>My Story<h1/>
When I was 5 Years old,I always visit the computer laboratory to play games and also edit pages.So I wondered what was used in making all this applications and programs.So I decided to do some research by asking our computer teacher.
She said that they were built through programming languages.By that time,I never knew what was programming. So She explained everything to me and I listened carefully and wrote it down.Then I also asked her how many programming language where there.My first thought was one,then she said over 50 programming languages.
So I was thinking how would learn over 50 languages. She later said that it depends on the language of my choice .She gave some programming languages like Java,C++,Python,Ruby etc.
When I became 8,I went to Cyber Café to search for programming languages that were popular and good.Then I saw HTML,So I started learning HTML.After Learning it,I started calling myself a coder.
At the age of 10,I realised that HTML was not a programming language and it needed other languages like CSS,JavaScript and PHP.So I abandoned HTML,I started learning Batch,I used it for making Viruses until one day I mistakenly open the virus on my Laptop and it got spoilt.So I decided not to make viruses again or learn any other languages.
At the Age of 13,I heard about Java so I downloaded PDF and applications to learn it.After two weeks,I could only write hello world in Java.When I wanted to learn others things than writing Hello World,I couldn’t understand anything at all.I later moved into C++,I understand stood it well.But i stopped halfway there beçause of school.So during our holiday friend introduced me to C# and I learnt it well and it was easy.So I learnt the framework,and started making my own programs and applications like a Text Editor,Music Player,HTML editor.I have also made lot of websites and projects which i can really stand by.Well i can say I am a fullstack Developer.

Programming languages
I have lots of mentor and people who guided me through these some which are : Shodipo Ayomide,Olugbenga Daniel,Totoola Kehinde and the rest.

So Think of what you wanna do and learn.
